Welcome to the [Pools Dubai](https://poolsdubai.com) website project.

This is a [Calvin Crane](https://calvincrane.com) project using primarily Next.JS.

## Why?

I wanted to go the full distance and product a static website using Next and Tailwind and other libraries, to test out some workflows and in particular SEO with respect to static sites. They are fast and the CWV scores should be excellent.
I also had never deployed a serious project to GitHub Pages before so that was also tested.
I use a python script backend to produce the blog posts and imagery. MD is limiting the easy use of YouTube embeds which I may get around to addressing.

## Next Steps

I would like to use MDX instead of just MarkDown for the content. For now Dec 2024 I need to see how Google likes the total SEO approach and if it gags on the AI blog posts which are not the best.
A proper contact form solution to be implemented.
Logo and Favicon for better branding.
